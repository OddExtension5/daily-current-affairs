## 😀Thought of the day

FAITH IS TAKING THE FIRST STEP EVEN WHEN YOU DON’T SEE  THE FULL STAIRCASE.”
 
## Joke of the day

 Pappu :- Yar iska matlab kya hota hai, "I AM GOING"?
 FRIEND :- Main jaa raha hun.
 Pappu :- Yaar, aise kaise jayega, 101 aur bhi aise ja chuke hain....answer bata ke jaa..

😳Why❓❓❓

Eid al-Fitr was originated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is observed on the first day of the Islamic month of Shawwal at the end of the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims undergo a period of fasting

Fasting during the holy month is one of the five pillars of Islam, which also include prayer and charity. To fast, Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and engaging in sexual activity from dawn to sunset. Muslims follow  the lunar calendar, which means Ramadan arrives several days earlier each year.

 ## 🤔 How it works ⁉

 How do igloos stay warm? 

Igloos are built out of bricks of ice. Unlike solid ice, which is a poor insulator for heat, all the compressed snow has more air pockets, making it a perfect insulator. All the cool air in an igloo goes to the bottom part and stays there. This means the upper area of the igloo remains warm.
