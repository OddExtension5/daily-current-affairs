## 😳Why❓❓❓

 Why do most of the Temples in India have a dome or conical shaped structure? 

We call this system as the Pancha-gopura system which accounts in Shilpa Shastra and Vayu Shastra of Atharva Veda.

Value of atmospheric pressure is 1 atm or 760 mm of hg.  But if you are under dome, which is a hemispheric hollow pyramid shape pressure distribution changes, then you will not feel so much force on your mind. Because due to round shape pressure gets spread on the rim/circumference of hemisphere of dome.

According to  Aagama Shastra. Those materials or rocks which have the capability to capture and reflect the sound waves the most must be chosen to build temple domes.  That’s why, once you enter any famous temple, you will observe silence and peace around you and the most fascinating thing is, we feel COOL and temperature in a temple is always less than the atmospheric temperature.

In all religious places the deity is placed at the center of the dome which is in a pyramid shape and all the electromagnetic waves are reflected to concentrate at this center and the Idol is positively charged. These electromagnetic waves are produced when one chant any Mantra. So different mantra have different powers. So when any devotee touches the feet of an idol, it gets a part of the positively charged power from the Idol, in whatever form it may be. Same is the reason why we touch the feet of our elders and they bless us by placing their hand on our head

It is a totally scientific process which are given by ancient saints.
Hinduism is not a religion. It is a way of life. A unique system bound with immense treasures of intricate knowledge of science.

 HOW A DEPILATORY CREAM OR A HAIR REMOVAL CREAM  DO THEY WORK? 

The way that depilatory creams work, is that they break down the keratin structure – the proteins, of the hair. This effectively thins and dissolves the base of the hairs to the point where they are weak enough to be broken off when the cream is wiped away. Once a depilatory dissolves the keratin, the hair becomes weak enough to fall loose from its follicle. The resulting substance is a bit like jelly, and it's possible to rub or wash off patches of hair with ease.

The cream contains many alkaline chemicals, hair removal creams will work for you depends on your hair and skin type. The body part on which you're applying cream and the amount of hair you have are factors, too.

## 🛕 VEDIK GNAN 

 Shri Hanuman  represented with orange colour?

Once Hanuman asked Sita mata why she wears a Sindhoor on her forehead. Sita mata replied “wearing a sindhoor on my forehead enhances the life of Sri Ram”!.

Sita’s answer overwhelmed Hanuman, and he thought, if a pinch of Sindhoor(kesari/orange)can increase the life span of Sri. Ram, then why not apply it all over my body so that Sri. Ram can live forever!.

Then he procured a bucket full of Sindhoor(kesari) and smeared his whole body with oil and Sindhoor!.

On the other side, Hanuman was born on a tuesday(mangalwar), the day of planet Mars or Mangal, the red planet!.

In astrology, they say, by wearing a red coral or wearing orange/kesari will nullify the negative effects of mars, which is the lord of conjugal relationship!. Afflicted mars in your horoscope may affect your marriage/married life, and maybe your life span too?!.
