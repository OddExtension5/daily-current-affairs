## 🤔 Why ⁉ 

Scientific reason behind ©:  Hanging lemon and chili tied to a thread outside of one's house/Shop/vehicles ⁉

The logic behind this  was that both lemon and chillies are rich sources of Vitamin C. So when a cotton thread is pierced through these substances, the cotton absorbs their nutrients and gradually vaporize them in air. Inhaling this air has health benefits.
Besides, the aroma (smell) from lemon and chillies keep insects and other pests away from the place.

Lemon and chilly were also tied to Bullock carts and other such modes of transport in the past. The reason being, when they used to travel through dense forests, there was a possibility of coming across snakes and other venomous creatures. There was no measure available to check whether a snake bite was poisonous or non-poisonous. In such cases lemon and chilly used to act as a parameter to check whether the bite was poisonous.

In case of a poisonous bite, the taste buds on the tongue won't be able to differ or identify sour and spicy taste which would alarm the person and help him in taking curative action accordingly.

 ## 🤷🏻‍♂️ HOW .... ⁉️

 How can only few birds hover in place? 🦅

The technical definition of hovering is to be be able to stay suspended in place in the air for a given period of time. Many birds can do this under the right conditions. The reason why hummingbirds are known to be the only birds to be able to hover is because they are the only birds who are evolutionarily equipped to fly in one place for many consecutive wing beats. They are the only birds that can hover in place without as much additional effort they normally require for general flying.

Eagles and other birds of prey can hover for short periods of time before diving in on ground-level or aquatic prey. Osprey Eagles like the one above are often found hovering for several seconds before calculating their dive while fishing.

 True hovering occurs by generating  through flapping alone, rather than by passage through the air, requiring considerable energy expenditure . This usually confines the ability to smaller birds, but some larger birds, such as a  Kite or  Osprey can hover for a short period of time. Although not a true hover, some birds remain in a fixed position relative to the ground or water by flying into a headwind. Hummingbirds, kestrels,  terns and  hawks use this wind hovering

Krestels are the only bird who can hover in place besides the hummingbirds. Krestels are incapable of beating their wings fast enough to generate lift to keep them aloft so they have to face into the wind. Hummingbirds are the premier hovering bird, although you will find that kestrels, hawks and terns can hover, too!
