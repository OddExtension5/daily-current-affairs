 ## ⁉WHY NEEDLES ARE NOT SOLD AT NIGHT ⁉
 
The main reason why needles are’nt sold after 6 PM i.e after sunset is that because in olden days there wouldn’t been any lights or anything of such kind (Perhaps! Yeah the chimneys were there but not that powerful as electric lights) and if needles are missed out somewhere it would be difficult to search in darkness and may lead to anything harmful!

Few more Similar things are:-
Not plucking nails at evening/night time
Not cutting hair
Not stitching clothes
Not whistling at night (attracts insects)

## 🧬HEALTH CARE: HOME REMEDIES🩺
( Note : These home tips followed in villages/ancient traditions, it is up to you to use it or not🙏🏻)
 
 STEAMING for your skin? 

It’s cleansing. Steam opens up your pores and helps loosen any buildup of dirt for a deeper cleanse. Opening up your pores also softens blackheads, making them easier to remove.

It releases trapped sebum. This naturally occurring oil is produced by your sebaceous glands to lubricate your skin and hair. When sebum gets trapped beneath your skin’s surface, it creates a breeding ground for bacteria and causes acne and blackheads.
